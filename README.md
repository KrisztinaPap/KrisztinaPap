# Hello Stranger!

## My name is Krisztina. Welcome to my GitHub profile! :wave:


### A few facts about me:
- :computer: I recently finished a full-stack software developer bootcamp
- :muscle: I'm currently working as a Developer Intern at a local start-up 
- :point_right: I have a web portfolio you can check out [here](https://krisztinapap.github.io/portfolio-project/)
- :heart: So far, I enjoy both front and back-end projects
- :brain: I dabble in data management and data science in my free time
- :grin: I'm currently building a simple app for my husband so he can track battle and tournament scores for his miniature wargaming hobby


### I like tables so I made one to tell you about my skills:
